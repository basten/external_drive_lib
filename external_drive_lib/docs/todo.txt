todo:
make it work for all external drives (even CDroms etc)
the progress dialog -> even if moved away from screen,if the user selects it via taskbar, presses Enter or Esc, it will cancel. i should disable the "cancel" button
implement copy on folders
bulk_copy: i should check if destination files exist, and auto-delete them. otherwise, i'll see the awesome "copy and replace" dialog.
try_parse_folder , try_parse_file ?so that i don't get exception when calling and file/folder doesn't exist
implement move()
