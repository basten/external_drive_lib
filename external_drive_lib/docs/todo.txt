add Terminology section

implement rename() on folders and on files

implement copy on folders
bulk_copy: i should check if destination files exist, and auto-delete them. otherwise, i'll see the awesome "copy and replace" dialog.
           see what to do -> i should do this for all files BEFORE copy
bulk_delete ?

copy_options - throw if destination file already exists / make destfolder if not found /TOTHINK

move() + bulk_move() -> the only reason i will have this is when moving into the same drive - that actually makes sense, because it could end up being very fast (instead of copy/delete)
--- when moving : have full destination name, like "c:\temp\a.jpg" -> "d:\pics\cool.jpg". in this case, i should figure out which are just rename (that is, same folder),
    and which are move to another folder + rename (and figure out if file already exists in destination folder)

make it work for all external drives (even CDroms etc)
