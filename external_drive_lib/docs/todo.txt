todo:
the progress dialog -> even if moved away from screen,if the user selects it via taskbar, presses Enter or Esc, it will cancel. i should disable the "cancel" button

bulk_copy: i should check if destination files exist, and auto-delete them. otherwise, i'll see the awesome "copy and replace" dialog.
implement move()
