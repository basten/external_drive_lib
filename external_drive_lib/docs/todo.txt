copy_sync, move_sync, delete_sync
            // -> wait like 10 times for file size. if different, continue. if same size (< what we expect) => throw
			     if fail -> throw exception maybe not complete?

delete_sync -> implement in android

look for "Copying#" (#32770) with child DirectUIHWND

see if android_file.exists actually works /same for android_folder and  android_drive.connected

use real unique_id + galaxy s6 is friendly name



bulk operations -> apparently sync operations win->android is slow (because of how we're testing to make sure it's good)



readme + licensing



todo:
make it work for all external drives (even CDroms etc)
implement move()
